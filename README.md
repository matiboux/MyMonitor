# MyMonitor

**MyMonitor** is an *open source PHP service* for monitoring the status of external services or websites for you.  
MyMonitor includes a panel to manage and view tracked services and their current status. Turn on or off notifications for when a service goes down.

Don't forget to add the cron to your crontab :

```
*/1 * * * * php [directory]/crontab.php
```
